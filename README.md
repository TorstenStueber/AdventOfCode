## Advent of code solutions

This is a complete list of my solutions to all [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

Some solutions are in JavaScript and some are done in Rust.

| Year | JavaScript | Rust |
| ---- | ---------- | ---- |
| 2015 | 100%       | 100% |
| 2016 | 100%       | 68%  |
| 2017 | 100%       | 0%   |
| 2018 | 100%       | 0%   |
| 2019 | 100%       | 0%   |
| 2020 | 100%       | 0%   |
| 2021 | 0%         | 88%  |
| 2022 | 0%         | 0%   |
| 2023 | 0%         | 0%   |
| 2024 | 0%         | 13%  |

The code is not optimized for readability and just to
get the job done. There is room for optimizations.

For each problem there is a solution that runs in under 15 seconds. Not all of my solutions satisfy
this criterion, however, I tried to find optimized solutions for a lot of them that should terminate after just a few seconds.
