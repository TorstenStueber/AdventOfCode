## Advent of code solutions

This is a complete list of my solutions to all [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

All solutions up to year 2020 are done in JavaScript. Year 2021 is written in Rust. The code is not optimized for readability and just to
get the job done. There is room for optimizations.

For each problem there is a solution that runs in under 15 seconds. Not all of my solutions satisfy
this criterion, however, I tried to find optimized solutions for a lot of them that should terminate after just a few seconds.
